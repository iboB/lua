This is Lua 5.3.1, released on 10 Jun 2015.

For installation instructions, license details, and
further information about Lua, see doc/readme.html.

FORK NOTES!!

* Added CMakeLists.txt (with a few configuration options)
* Fixed some 64-bit compilation warnings
* Parser change: function calls with all literal types of arguments without
parentheses (not only strings)
* Added support for new Ruby-style anonymous function definition (with pipes)

    foo = |args|
        code
    end

* The new function syntax is also interpreted as literal

    foo || code end
    -- is eqiuvalent to
    foo(function () code end)
